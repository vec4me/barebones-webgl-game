[Notes]
	The thing should describe itself so well that everything else just works around it with minimal intrusion. So nothing externally should assign to it.
This means things might need to overdescribe themselves, but maybe that's worth it?
It's either overdescribe oneself or have everything else need to try making it work with said thing.
Overdescriving oneself seems more congruent. And we should be maximizing congruency.
